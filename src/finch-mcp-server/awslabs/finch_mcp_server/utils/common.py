"""Common utility functions for the Finch MCP server.

This module provides shared utility functions used across the Finch MCP server,
including command execution and result formatting.

    """Execute a command and return the result.

    This is a utility function that handles the execution of CLI commands.
    It sets up the proper environment variables (particularly HOME) and captures
    both stdout and stderr output from the command.

    Args:
        command: List of command parts to execute (e.g., ['finch', 'vm', 'status'])
               Note: Currently only 'finch' commands are allowed for security reasons.
        env: Optional environment variables dictionary. If None, uses a copy of the
             current environment with HOME set to the user's home directory.

    Returns:
        CompletedProcess object with command execution results, containing:
        - returncode: The exit code of the command (0 typically means success)
        - stdout: Standard output as text
        - stderr: Standard error as text

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the command is not a finch command (doesn't start with 'finch')
